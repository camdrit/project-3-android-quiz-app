# project-3-android-quiz-app

This is a simple Android app made for Project 3 of the Android Techdegree on https://teamtreehouse.com. It makes use of a constraint layout with TextViews, RadioGroups, RadioButtons, and Buttons to create a quiz interface that prompts the user to solve simple addition problems. The questions are generated using a custom class that randomly generates two addends.
